This repository contains detailed analysis of the healthcare data provided by PicnicHealth for an interview.

Individual notebooks can be found in the repository. The analysis takes place as follows:

patients --> conditions --> health --> medical-access

# Takeaways from analysis:

- Initially, we saw the population size decreasing in Massandapolis since 1990s, and observed very high mortality rates since 1990s. Another thing we observed was irish population was largely unaffected by this decrease.
- Then we analyzed different conditions, and observed Addiction issues plaguing the state all through 1990s, and that saw quite a rise in Dental and Chronic Pain problems affecting the population.
- When analyzing individual health of people, we observed Massandapoleans to be very unhealthy. Throughout decades, we saw obesity issues, with people weighing heavy and having high BMIs and high blood pressures. Being obese, also brings a lot of other health problems, like we saw with high cholestrol (bad cholestrol) levels and high creatinine and chloride levels in individuals.
- I also hypothesized that lack of medical facilities and care could be one of the factors affecting health, and rising mortality rates, but the data suggested otherwise. The data available did not indicate any relation towards different sections of society lacking in medical care.

# Future analysis 
- With more clarity on the relationships between conditions and the medications, I would have liked to investigate medical care and treatments in greater detail, but unfortunately, I could not do that, as this is the only information and data I have available.
